### Design for Flexibility.

Using a living styleguide ensures patterns adapt correctly to meet user needs, offering variation, and yet, providing design consistency and familiarity. It also allows us to build components that work well in multiple digital channels. 

### Reuseable Best Practices

This styleguide enables you to design, develop, test, review, and repurpose patterns, code, and design. That results in a comprehensive collection of tried-and-tested assets that reflect industry best practices.
